# midirandia

midirandia is a random midi generator and player

It creates a random MIDI file, converts it to WAV using a soundfont file, then plays and deletes that wav.

It's basically a funny little noisemaker.

## What does it fix, specifically?

<todo>



## Installation: Python

Install the appropriate packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Testing



## Those wacky BAT files?

I use TCC -- Take Command Command Line.
Technically, my .BAT files are .BTM files.
They're really for me, but sometimes I include them in my repo since I want them version controlled, too.
